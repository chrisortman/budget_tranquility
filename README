Budget Tranquility
========================

My wife and I track our budget using a simple spreadsheet

We use only cash for all our purchases and only want to keep in our checking account
enough money to cover recurring expenses that we have setup for autopay.

In our spreadsheet we track our monthly expenses and amounts we need for each 'envelope'. We use envelopes for cash and separate out things such as groceries and clothing.

I wanted to refresh myself on Rails so decided to build this setup as a new rails app.



This application was generated with the rails_apps_composer gem:
https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer
provided by the RailsApps Project:
http://railsapps.github.io/
